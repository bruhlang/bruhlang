# `bruhlang`

ðŸ‘¾A cohesive, simplistic language to denote bruh-able messages. 

Contributing guide and full language features coming soon. Stay tuned!

*NOTE:* This is a joke and a completely useless language. :)

## Core

First, let's write a simple _"Hello World"_ program with Bruh:

```py
bruh => "Hello World"
```

The `bruh` keyword is the standard to write `bruh statements` to the console/terminal throughout the entire language. The statement outlined below will print:

```bash
BRUH: "Somebody just told me that PHP is the best language."
```

### Bruh Statements

Statements in `bruhlang` are denoted with `bruh => "Some text"` and represent the essentiality of the language. By convention, in order fr a message to be *bruh-able*, the text within the quotes shall represent something that is representable with the word `bruh`.
